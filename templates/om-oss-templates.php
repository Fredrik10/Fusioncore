  <p> About Fredrik
My name is Fredrik, I am soon to be 18 years of age so I can make my own life long decisions about what I want in life. Me and my own sibling David (not the person below)we were born in Sweden but my parents and other relatives came to this country as foreigners and now must of them are citizens. What interest me the most in school is math, physics and obviously P.E. But what I enjoy to do on my spare time is to play some PS4, watch a movie/TV-show and spend time with my loved ones. </p>
